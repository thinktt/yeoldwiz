After researching Chessmaster on my old PC it seems the base strenght listed 
may come out at about 5000 level egnine lines, going to try and limit the non 
ponder personalalties to this

When turning this up for Capablanca Lichess game I noticed the engine seemed
to play similar strenght but took less time to move

Strenght of lines seem to max aout at about 11000 or 12000, perhaps getting past
that is just exponetnionally dificult for the engine. Mind you this is all time
controls 5 to ten Seconds per move.
