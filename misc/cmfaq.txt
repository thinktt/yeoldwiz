Chessmaster 10th Edition, another great upgrade to Ubisoft's classic 
franchise, truly is the ultimate teacher, mentor, and opponent for beggining, 
intermediate, and advanced players alike. At the Academy, International Master 
Josh Waitzkin will personally walk players through the basics of chess, plus 
introduce a variety of simple strategies for dominating your opponent. The 
Academy also features the best attacking moves as taught by noted chess 
champion Larry Christiansen. Seasoned chess players can test their skills 
against ranked AI opponents, set up tournaments and simultaneous exhibitions, 
and survey their performances using the new statistics system. Although 
perhaps the largest improvement this game brings to the Chessmaster series is 
the completely revised, full-featured chess module. More than just a place to 
play chess live with other players, Chessmaster online allows players to 
establish rankings, create tournaments, utilize teaching tools, and join a 
thriving chess community.

Featuring 13 game modes, CM10 promises to improve every player's game, 
regardless of their current skill level. Chessmaster has always been known for 
its powerful mentor tools, and CM10 certainly keeps the tradition alive with a 
large arsenal of coaching strategies, tutorials, tests, and puzzles. Below 
you'll find a brief explanation of each game mode.







                               /===============\
                              (  TRAINING MODE  )
                               \===============/

Training mode allows you to pit up against the AI personality of your choosing 
in a non-competitive environment. If this is the first time you've played, 
Chessmaster will choose your opponent automatically, according to your rating. 
From the second match onward, you will face the last opponent you played 
against.

In this game mode, usage of the Chess Coach, Blunder Alert, and Take Back 
Move features are permitted. Additionally, Quick Hints and Advice are 
available via the Shortcuts Bar.

If you need to brush up on your game, or simply want a little more practice, 
this is the place to be. CM10 also provides you with powerful game analysis 
tools in this mode. Chessmaster can solve for mate (if there is one), analyze 
a set of moves, and provide you with a detailed report of the current 
situation. All these tools can be accessed via the Mentor menu.


                                /=============\
                               (  RANKED PLAY  )
                                \=============/

Ranked Play is the only game mode where you can improve your rating. Every 
game here counts. When setting up a game, you can view how many rating points 
you'll gain/lose if you win, lose, or draw against the currently selected 
opponent. If playing against relatively low-ranked opponents, it is possible 
to lose rating points even if the game results in a win. To some extent, this 
makes sure you can't pull off any "cheap" wins for quick rating points.

During this game mode the Chess Coach, Blunder Alert, Take Back Move, Quick 
Hint, and Advice features cannot be used during play.


                              /=================\
                             (  SET UP POSITION  )
                              \=================/

This game mode is where I always stop at first if I wish to play out both 
sides of a particular game. If you've ever wanted to play as your opponent in 
a few situations, you'll find yourself spending much time here. This game mode 
allows you to set up any possible position on a chessboard and play through it 
for both sides.

The Chess Coach and Mentor commands are available in this game mode.

With experience, I've found that extensive use of the Chess Coach in this game 
mode allows for quick, powerful analyses of complicated games.


                                /=============\
                               (  TOURNAMENTS  )
                                \=============/

In my opinion, perhaps the most enjoyable of all game modes. As the name 
suggests, this game mode allows participation in tournaments of varying 
difficulty. 

Tournaments already included with the game, or pre-defined 
tournaments, are grouped into several difficulty categories: "Apprentices", 
"Initiates", "Adepts", "Masters", and "Style". The "Apprentices" difficulty 
category covers rating levels from 0 to 1200. The "Initiates" difficulty 
category covers difficulty ratings ranging from 1000-1800. The "Adepts" 
category covers ratings from 1600-2200, and the "Masters" category covers 
ratings 2200 and above. The "Style" category features players of varying 
playing styles. These include aggresive, defensive, fast, balanced, traders, 
tacticians, and positional play.

As you already may know, this game mode also allows creation of new 
tournaments, also known as user-defined tournaments. When creating a new 
tournament, many options, such as the time controls and tournament type (Round 
Robin or Swiss) can be modified.


                                   /========\
                                  (  ONLINE  )
                                   \========/

Offering a quick way to get some human competition, online play allows for the 
participation in and viewing of intense (often times) chess games. To get 
going, you'll need an internet connection (obviously) and an Ubisoft account. 
If you don't have an Ubisoft account at first, CM10 allows for the creation of 
one without launching a web browser. Once all set up, you'll be taken to the 
main lobby where you can view, host, or join a game. Unfortunately, games are 
often buggy, and sometimes the servers completely fail (although this 
occurrence is seldom). For the most part, the interface is pretty self-
explanatory.

                                    /=====\
                                   (  LAN  )
                                    \=====/

Yes folks, CM10 can be enjoyed at LAN parties as well. Allowing for LAN play 
via this game mode, this is Chessmaster's second means of catching some human 
competition. The interface and commands are similar to those of the online 
game mode. Once again, all actions and hotkeys are very much self-explanatory.


                                   /=========\
                                  (  ACADEMY  )
                                   \=========/

The Academy allows you to learn from some of the game's greatest masters, 
including Josh Waitzkin and Larry Christiansen. If you're just learning the 
game, and have no prior knowledge of general chess strategy, I highly 
recommend taking a look at Josh Waitzkin's Academy. The academy teaches proper 
piece movement, basic algebraic notation, and more. Waitzkin's academy also 
includes some useful quizzes (two of which are mate quizzes).


    _____          /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\          _____
   /     \--------(                                        )--------/     \

   ¯¯¯¯¯           \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/           ¯¯¯¯¯


In almost every game mode, you're given the option to choose your opponent 
(also known as a "personality") when starting a new game. Chessmaster provides 
you with a wide array of people to choose from, ranging from world 
grandmasters to 5-year-old children who have just learned the game. And the 
selection doesn't stop there. Chessmaster has given each personality a unique 
playing style, so you're bound to find some tough competition.

A common misunderstanding many players have regarding Chessmaster 10th 
Edition's rating system is the consistency of personalities' ratings. 
Personality ratings change each time the game loads up, based upon the 
processor speed, current memory usage, and RAM available to the engine. Each 
personality has a base rating, and extra points are added for excess of memory 
and processor power, in relevance to the minimum system requirements.

All personality ratings in this guide reflect each opponent's "base rating". 
Therefore, ratings will most likely differ based on your system's RAM, 
available memory, and programs currently in cache. Although this difference is 
usually 1-3 rating points.



 .-------------.
(  CHESSMASTER  )
 '-------------'
 [RATING]
 2724

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 The Chessmaster's exact origins are shrouded in mystery, but it is believed 
 that he was created in a top-secret chess laboratory from bits and silicon. 
 His wise and kindly presence has presided over the finest chess program in 
 the world since 1986.

 [SYLE]
 Chessmaster 10th Edition is powered by version 3.33 of The King chess engine.  
 On this system, Chessmaster is rated at 2724 U.S.


 .----------.
(  ALEKHINE  )
 '----------'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Alexander Alexandrovich Alekhine was born to aristocracy in Moscow, Russia, 
 and was taught chess at age 11 by his mother. Alekhine's personality left a 
 lot to be desired; he was devious, nervous, restless, and a heavy smoker and 
 drinker. Though a chess genius in his own right, he held his contemporary and 
 rival, Capablanca, in very high regards. Surprisingly, in 1927, he toppled 
 Capablanca to gain the world championship and then studiously avoided any 
 subsequent rematch. Alekhine's penchant for drink caught up with him with his 
 loss to Euwe in 1935. He then gave up drinking and smoking to regain it in 
 1937. During World War II he played in many tournaments in Germany and 
 German-occupied countries. After the war he was criticized as an anti-Semite, 
 a charge he firmly denied. He spent the last years of his life in Spain as he 
 was endeavoring the British Chess Federation to organize a match between him 
 and Botvinnik. 

 [SYLE]
 The Alekhine-style in Chessmaster 10th Edition has a razor-sharp tactical 
 sense, combining stormy attacks with superb endgame technique. This 
 personality's meticulous opening preparation allows it to experiment at will 
 with gambits galore.


 .-------.
(  ANAND  )
 '-------'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Viswanathan Anand, born in Madras, is the best player India ever produced and 
 was ranked in the world's top ten since the early 1990s. He has unusually 
 quick sight of the board, is noted for playing fast, and is one of the best-
 liked grandmasters on the circuit. In 1995 he dropped a PCA world 
 championship match to Kasparov despite taking an early lead by drawing the 
 first eight games and winning the ninth. In 1998 he dropped a short FIDE 
 title bout to Karpov in overtime after achieving a 3-3 tie. Later that year 
 Anand won Linares ahead of Kasparov and five other top rated stars, yet he 
 declined another shot at the PCA title because of contractual obligations to 
 FIDE.

 [SYLE]
 The Anand-style in Chessmaster 10th Edition is resourceful, often finding 
 ways to draw or even win in inferior positions. Noted for attacking skill, 
 deep calculation and tactical ability, this personality prefers 1. e4 as 
 White and likes solid, classical defenses with Black.


 .-----------.
(  ANDERSSEN  )
 '-----------'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 It is noteworthy that Adolf Anderssen, a math professor who hailed from 
 Breslau, Germany, terms his own attacks as 'traps' and nothing more. His 
 combinations were an inspiration of the moment and didn't always flow out of 
 the position, organically. Morphy knew not only how to attack but also when 
 -- and that is why he won. Nonetheless, Anderssen's victory at the first 
 great modern tournament in London 1851 established him as the best player in 
 the world until he lost a close match to Steinitz in 1866.

 [SYLE]
 The Anand-style in Chessmaster 10th Edition is resourceful, often finding 
 ways to draw or even win in inferior positions. Noted for attacking skill,

 White and likes solid, classical defenses with Black.


 .------.
(  BIRD  )
 '------'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Born in Portsea, Hampshire, Henry Edward Bird was one of the leading British 
 amateurs of last century and is best known today by the opening named after 
 him (1. f4). He learned chess at age 10 by watching players at a coffee house 
 in London; by 16 he was a regular at the Divan in the Strand. He was strong 
 enough to be invited to the first great international tournament at London 
 1851. When he lost to Morphy in 1858 Bird was only 28 and remained active for 
 almost another 50 years. An outstanding accountant, he wrote a book entitled 
 'An Analysis of Railways in the United Kingdom' and also authored several 
 chess treatises.

 [SYLE]
 The Bird-style offers the qunitessential 19th century approach. This 
 personality cares little for chess theory, and will gleefully choose openings 
 generally regarded as bizarre, often ignoring positional considerations to 
 pursue the attack for all it is worth. Don't underestimate its playing 
 strength, however, as it has beaten several other Chessmaster personalities, 
 particularly in games with fast time controls.


 .------------.
(  BLACKBURNE  )
 '------------'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Nicknamed 'the black death', Joseph Henry Blackburne was born in Manchester. 
 He learned chess at 18 and remained England's best player for over 50 years, 
 touring the country regularly and giving blindfold displays. He became a 
 professional after winning his national title in 1869. His greatest success 
 came at Berlin 1881 where he finished ahead of every leading master. But he 
 lost three matches to Steinitz and one to Lasker. His capacity for scotch was 
 enormous; legend has it he was so enraged at Steinitz during one of their 
 games that he picked him up and almost threw him out the window.

 [SYLE]
 The Blackburne-style in Chessmaster 10th Edition is what we might call a 
 coffee-house player, an unabashed tactician who disdains positional 
 considerations. Against top defensive players, this personality will often 
 come to grief, but is capable of uncorking a brilliant tactical stroke at any 
 time.


 .------------.
(  BOGOLJUBOW  )
 '------------'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Efim Bogoljubow was born in the Ukraine and became a German citizen during 
 the 1920s. He twice challenged Alekhine for the title, in 1929 and 1934, but 
 was crushed on both occasions. His greatest victories came at Moscow 1925 and 
 Bad Kissingen 1928 where he finished well ahead of Capablanca. Alternating 
 between brilliant success and lamentable failure, Bogoljubow was a born 
 optimist who remained unperturbed by losses. 'The youngsters have read my 
 book,' he wailed in his jovial manner. 'Now I have no chance'. He won the 
 German championship for the fourth and last time in 1949.
 
 [SYLE]
 The Bogoljubow-style is mainly positional, with the ability to exploit 
 strategic weaknesses in an opponent. This personality has a good all-around 
 game, but may overrate its chances against the very best.


 .-----------.
(  BOTVINNIK  )
 '-----------'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Mikhail Moiseyevich Botvinnik was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, and became 
 the symbol of Soviet supremacy at chess. In 1948 he won a match- tournament 
 organized by FIDE to fill the crown left vacant by Alekhine's death. He 
 defended it twice with 12-12 ties in 1951 and 1954, then lost to Smyslov in 
 1957 but won a rematch in 1958. In 1960 he lost to Tal but regained it in 
 1961. Petrosian finally put him away for good in 1963. An electrical 
 engineer, Botvinnik devoted his final years to perfecting chess computers and 
 founding a chess school where his most famous student was Garry Kasparov.
 
 [SYLE]
 A profound technician and iron logician, the Botvinnik-style will always seek 
 the objectively best move. This personality has excellent endgame technique 
 and a varied, solid opening book, especially where the French Defense, Dutch 
 Defense, Semi- Slav and English Opening are concerned. Its only weakness is 
 that it sometimes gets into time control problems, especially in blitz games.


 .------------.
(  CAPABLANCA  )
 '------------'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Jose Raul Capablanca, born in Havana, already won a match at age 12 from the 
 best player in Cuba. As a grown man, he was extremely charismatic, always 
 dressed immaculately and had strong sense of honor. His understanding of 
 chess was innate; the first major tournament he attempted was one of the 
 strongest in the world and he came in first place (a distinction shared only 
 with Pillsbury). After the first World War he was considered so invincible 
 that his nickname became 'the chess machine'. In 1921 he captured the world 
 championship from Lasker, but then surprisingly lost it to Alekhine in 1927. 
 His intuition was phenomenal, his speed incredible. 'What others could not 
 discover in a month, he saw at a glance,' noted Fine. He played prolifically 
 and in his time, no other master sustained as few losses as he.

 [SYLE]
 Among all the Chessmaster 10th Edition opponents, the Capablanca-style is the 
 most straightforward and classical. This personality shuns unclear 
 complications and generally tries to keep everything under control, steering 
 for simple positions that allow it to build on tiny advantages, often 
 converting seemingly drawn games into wins.

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Mikhail Chigorin was the first of the great Russian Grandmasters, and one of 
 the four top players in the world -- along with Lasker, Steinitz, and 
 Tarrasch -- from the 1880s to the turn of the century. While he won some 
 brilliant games, he sometimes stumbled in the endgame. Chigorin contested for 
 the world championship against Steinitz in both 1886 and 1892. Though 
 Chigorin lost both times, the matches are notable for their incredible 
 competitiveness, with only six draws in 40 games!

 [SYLE]
 The Chigorin-style, unlike many modeled after those of the Romantic period, 
 can actually play defense, and also has an understanding of positional play. 
 Even so, this personality is a feared attacker, and has no problem uncorking 
 the Evans Gambit on an unsuspecting opponent.

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Larry Christiansen is one of the most famous attacking players in the history 
 of American chess. He gained his GM norm at 23, before even winning his first 
 US Champion title - his three US champion titles date from 1980, 1983 and 
 2002. He was also a four-time runner-up for the title, as well as 11-time US 
 Olympiad team member, winning the gold Olympic medal as a team member in 1993 
 and winning the silver as a non-player team captain in 1998. He has won over 
 20 international tournaments, including Linares 1979 and 1981. He is the 
 chess coach of the MIT Chess Club, and also wrote a dozen chess books, 
 Storming the Barricades being the most widely known.

 [SYLE]
 An aggressive and tactical player, Christiansen's favorite opening is the 
 Saemisch King's Indian. As Black he likes Modern Benoni vs 1 d4 and Paulsen 
 Sicilian. He enjoys steamroller-type attacks with a gradual buildup ending in 
 a series of sacrifices. A sharp and practical technique.

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Machgielis 'Max' Euwe was born in Amsterdam, Holland. A mathematics teacher, 
 he became the first real amateur to win the world championship in 1935. It 
 was considered a fluke and he sportingly agreed to a rematch in 1937, thus 
 enabling Alekhine to regain the crown. Euwe also found time for flying, 
 swimming and boxing in addition to writing numerous chess books. From 1970-78 
 he was president of FIDE and visited more than 100 countries at his own 
 expense to popularize the game in Africa and Asia.

 [SYLE]
 The Euwe-style is an openings expert, familiar with the entire range of 
 opening variations. Although hypermodern ideas are often seen in this 
 personality's games as White, it will stick with classical lines as Black, 
 and particularly enjoys the Slav Defense. A fun opponent, one that will give 
 you a lot of variety over a number of games.

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 The five US chess championships of Larry Evans span four decades. Evans 
 earned his first US title at the age of 19, served as Bobby Fischer's second 
 for the world championship, won the US Open four times, and was a member or 
 captain of nine Olympic teams (capturing several gold and silver medals along 
 the way). He has drawn or beaten six world champions (Euwe, Fischer, Karpov, 
 Petrosian, Smyslov, Spassky) as well as dozens of the world's top players. 
 One of America's leading Chess authorities, Evans has written more than 20 
 books on chess, including a revision of the monumental 10th edition of Modern 
 Chess Openings, commonly known as the Chess Bible. He retired from play to 
 put more time into his syndicated newspaper column, and was named Chess 
 Journalist Of The Year in 2000. Grandmaster Evans is a frequent contributor 
 to Chessmaster.

 [SYLE]
 Basically a counter-puncher, the Evans-style is fond of the English as White 
 and the King's Indian and Sicilian as Black. A fierce defender and avid pawn 
 snatcher, this personality has been known to suffer for hours nursing a lowly 
 pawn all the way to victory. So, be careful with those gambits against this 
 opponent!

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Reuben Fine was born in New York City, USA. During the 1930s the rivalry 
 between him and Reshevsky was white hot as they led American teams to victory 
 in the chess Olympiads. Fine won the USA Open seven times but could never 
 wrest the national title from his nemesis. Fine's greatest feat was tying for 
 first with Keres at AVRO 1938, ahead of Reshevsky and four world champions, 
 past and present. After the war, unable to make a living from chess, Fine was 
 faced with a hard choice. He became a psychologist, declined to take part in 
 the 1948 world championship, and stopped competing altogether in 1951. Yet he 
 remained America's premier chess author; his classics include 'Basic Chess 
 Endings', 'The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings', 'Lessons From My Games', and 
 'The World's Great Chess Games'.

 [SYLE]
 A preference for the open game characterizes the Fine-style, which will seek 
 the initiative right from the first move. This personality is tough to beat 
 because of its encyclopedic grasp of the openings, where it is equally 
 comfortable with 1.d4 or 1. e4. And if you can survive the opening, the Fine-
 style is also renowned for its craftiness in the endgame.

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Robert James 'Bobby' Fischer was born in Chicago, raised in Brooklyn, New 
 York. He won the USA Championship at the unheard-of age of 14 in 1958. He was 
 a dominant player throughout the 1960s but developed a reputation for being 
 difficult by insisting on very specific playing conditions. Fischer's 
 ambition was firmly set on the world championship and in 1972 he got his 
 chance. He was set to play Boris Spassky for the title. No match in the 
 history of the game received more publicity. Fischer soundly defeated Spassky 
 and became the first American to win the world championship. He then withdrew 
 from serious play and in 1975 forfeited his title to Karpov. He became a 
 recluse and did not compete again until 1992 when a Yugoslav entrepreneur 
 organized a rematch with Spassky for $5 million ($3.35 million to the winner 
 and $1.65 million to the loser). Once again Fischer defeated his old rival 
 and once again vanished from the public eye, probably forever.

 [SYLE]
 Grounded on extensive opening analysis and backed up by superb endgame 
 technique, the Fischer-style is direct, vigorous and relentlessly aggressive. 
 This personality disdains draws and has an intense will to win. This 
 personality will almost always open 1. e4 as White, and favors the Najdorf 
 Sicilian or King's Indian as Black.

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Salo Flohr was born in Poland and moved to Czechoslovakia after his parentS 
 were killed during a pogrom. From 1928 to 1937 he competed in 42 tournaments, 
 winning or sharing first in half of them. A hero in his adopted homeland, he 
 endorsed products such as cigars, collars and pastries. By 1937 he was 
 designated as Alekhine's official challenger but was unable to raise a purse 
 and his hopes were dashed after finishing last at AVRO a year later when a 
 younger generation emerged led by Keres and Fine. He lost his fighting spirit 
 and became increasingly cautious, adopting a policy of safety first, settling 
 for tame draws, content to demonstrate equality with his peers. After WWII 
 Flohr moved to the USSR where he served as a popular and witty chess 
 journalist.

 [SYLE]
 In the early days, the Flohr-style tended toward the attack, but now goes 
 more for positional play, relying on queen pawn openings. While efficient, 
 this personality will shun risks, and may offer a draw when other opponents 
 might struggle on.

 age.

 [SYLE]
 Renowned for opening expertise, the Geller-style can mix it up with the best

 [SYLE]
 While generally preferring to defend, the Ivanchuk-style in Chessmaster 10th

 championship of Leningrad at age 12 and defected with his father to the USA 
 during the New York Open in 1989. Kamsky swiftly established himself as top 
 dog by winning the USA championship in 1991. At 21 he defeated Anand, Salov, 
 Short and Kramnik in preliminary matches to earn a title shot against FIDE 
 champion Karpov in 1996. After taking home the loser's share of $562,500 
 Kamsky declared he was giving up chess to study medicine.

 uncomfortable.

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Anatoly Karpov was born in Zlatoust in the former Soviet Union. He won the 
 FIDE title twice by default: in 1975 when Fischer refused to play and in 1993 
 when Kasparov formed the Professional Chess Association. Karpov was the 
 darling of the Kremlin and his two title defenses against Soviet defector 
 Korchnoi in 1978 and 1981 were marred by the fact that the challenger's 
 family was held hostage inside the USSR. A marathon match with Kasparov in 
 1984 was halted by FIDE after 48 games and almost six months when an 
 exhausted Karpov was leading by two points. He lost the title to Kasparov in 
 1985 and failed to get it back despite three more matches culminating in 
 1990. Karpov regained the FIDE crown against Timman in 1993, Kamsky in 1996 
 and Anand in 1998. He was the most active champion in history and won more 
 first prizes in major events (some 150) than any other great player.

 [SYLE]
 The accurate positional play of the Karpov-style hides the fact that this 
 opponent can be aggressive when called for. This personality likes to build 
 small yet persistent advantages without incurring unnecessary risks or making 
 mistakes, and is quite fond of 1. e4 as White and the Caro-Kann and Queen's 
 Indian Defense as Black.

 founded Chess Review magazine, and was chess editor of the LA Times.

 with Alekhine, then won Semmering 1937 ahead of Capablanca. A tie with Fine 
 at AVRO 1938 ahead of Alekhine, Botvinnik, Capablanca, Euwe, Flohr and 
 Reshevsky earned Keres a title shot against Alekhine -- except for the advent 
 of W.W.II. After the war evidence indicates Soviet officials prevented him 
 from interfering with Botvinnik's ascension to the crown. Keres was an 
 excellent openings analyst who originated several important lines and 
 strengthened many variations.

 the powerful USSR Championship four times before defecting to the USA in 
 1976. In 1978 and 1981, while his family was held hostage inside the USSR, he 
 lost two title matches to Karpov, after which his wife and son were freed. In 
 1983 he dropped a semi-final match to Kasparov, ending his chance to 
 challenge Karpov again. Even in his late sixties, Korchnoi is still 
 dangerous, and in 2002, he became the oldest player to ever win a 
 professional tournament.

 Since bursting on the world chess scene in 1992, Kramnik displayed a maturity 
 of play far beyond his years. Over a period of 18 months, leading up to July 
 2000, Kramnik set a record by remaining undefeated in over 80 games played at 
 the highest level. He quickly gained the distinction as one of the few who 
 was able to give Kasparov a run for his money. Before their Braingames title 
 match at London in October 2000, where Kramnik astonished everyone by 
 winning, they had met 23 times at classical time limits, and the score was 
 three wins apiece with 17 draws. Since then, however, Kramnik has been 
 relatively inactive. Despite a triumph at Dortmund in 2001, his results have 
 fallen below expectation, and many fans do not consider him a worthy 
 successor to Kasparov. A unification match planned for October 2003 may 
 settle the issue of who is the best player on the planet.

 [SYLE]
 Quite well-rounded, the Kramnik-style in Chessmaster 10th Edition is equally 
 at home with 1.e4 or 1.d4 or 1.c4, all of which can cause problems for 
 opponents not as well-versed in the intricacies of those openings. As Black, 
 this personality is fond of the Queen's Gambit Accepted, is skilled at the 
 Berlin Defense, and is prepared to patiently defend long endgames in order to 
 blunt the opponent's opening initiative.

 at age 6 and was the first Westerner to pose the Soviet bloc a serious 
 challenge. In 1956 he won fame at the Moscow Olympiad as overall high scorer 
 on first board (+11 -1 = 6). His results continued to be spectacular, and 
 from 1967 to 1970 he failed to win first prize only once in nine consecutive 
 events. His play faltered after 1971 when Fischer trounced him 6-0 in a world 
 championship qualifying match; yet Larsen remained in demand from organizers 
 because he always plays to win and takes calculated risks that delight 
 spectators.

 [SYLE]
 The Larsen-style in Chessmaster 10th Edition is an unabashed original who

 also wrote about mathematics and philosophy. He did not wish to devote his 
 life to chess, but financial pressure always forced him back. His classic 
 book 'Lasker's Manual Of Chess' describes his approach to the game and pays 
 tribute to the revolutionary theories of Steinitz, the champion he deposed.

 [SYLE]
 Of all the Chessmaster 10th Edition opponents, the Lasker-style will more

 At 14, Peter Leko became the youngest Grandmaster ever. His victory in the 
 Under-16 World Championship began a meteoric rise. In 1998, at Dortmund, 
 Madrid and Tilburg, he lost only once in 40 games against the world's elite. 
 By January 2001, he already was ranked number five in the world, and later in 
 2001, Leko won a rapid match against Kramnik, who had just conquered Kasparov 
 for the title. An idol in his own country, since 1999 Leko has been supported 
 by RWE Gas AG in Dortmund, Germany, an unusual arrangement for top players. 
 His greatest weakness is a lack of aggression and a tendency to agree to 
 peaceful draws. But he is extremely hard to beat and competitors often refer 
 to him as 'bulletproof'. To improve, he hired a professional coaching team 
 consisting of three Grandmasters, and on all his travels he is accompanied by 
 his Armenian wife, Sofie. All his hard work seems to be paying dividends. In 
 2002 he won the first FIDE Grand Prix rapid tournament in Dubai.

 career as a lawyer. He grasped the principles of chess before anyone else and 
 today his insights are accepted by all serious players. He abhorred being 
 considered a chess pro, believing it was not a fit profession for a grown 
 man. In an era when the dynamic young nation suffered from a cultural 
 inferiority complex, he was the toast of America after going to Europe and 
 defeating their best players, including Adolf Anderssen, who later lost a

 [SYLE]
 Of all the Chessmaster 10th Edition opponents, the Morphy-style is the most

 Najdorf first made his mark as high-scorer for the Polish team at the 1935 
 chess Olympiad. At the outbreak of WWII, during the chess Olympiad of 1939, 
 he sought asylum in Argentina, along with a number of other European stars. 
 In 1947, he set a blindfold record by taking on 45 players simultaneously (+
 39 -2 = 4). From 1950 to 1976, Najdorf fielded first board on the Argentine 
 team in 11 Chess Olympiads. In 1949, he drew a match with Fine (+2 -2 = 4) 
 and then lost two matches against Reshevsky in what became known as the 
 championship of the free world. In a long career he was champion of three 
 nations: Poland, Hungary and Argentina. He always played colorful chess and 
 conducted the middle game with virtuosity; but at the highest level his skill 
 in the opening and ending did not match his leading contemporaries. One of 
 the most popular lines in the Sicilian Defense, the indestructible Najdorf 
 Variation, (1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6) was named in 
 his honor.

 [SYLE]
 The Najdorf-style has a varied enough repertoire that you cannot expect a 
 particular move, but does have certain conspicuous preferences. As White, 
 this personality distinctly favors 1.d4 with a secondary interest in the 
 English/Reti systems, and as Black, leans toward more combative choices -- 
 King's Indians and Sicilians, with an occasional Queen's Indian or Philidor 
 Defense.

 Aaron Nimzowitsch, born in Riga, Latvia, was the greatest player of the 
 hypermodern school. In 1922 he emigrated to Denmark and from a small rented 
 room in Copenhagen penned 'My System' and other classics that deeply 
 influenced future generations. His finest result was winning Carlsbad 1929 
 ahead of Capablanca but a compulsion to prove his 'unorthodox' theories and 
 'mysterious' moves sometimes proved costly in tournaments. He made decisive 
 contributions to opening theory; he revived the Winawer Variation of the 
 French Defense, the Queen's Indian and Nimzo-Indian Defense. He also coined 
 many memorable phrases such as 'the pawn has a lust to expand', 
 'prophylaxis' and 'the bishop bites on granite'. Two of his most famous 
 disciples are Petrosian and Karpov.

 [SYLE]
 Spawned by the the hypermodern school, the Nimzowitsch-style believes that 
 control of the center does not necessarily imply occupation by pawns. This 
 personality likes maneuvering in closed and cramped positions, and loves 
 having an overextended enemy center to attack.

 to Morphy, Paulsen continued to improve, and was one of the top players in 
 the world until 1889. He excelled at match play, and won tournaments that 
 featured such greats as Anderssen and Zukertort. Paulsen is notable as the 
 first great master to stress defense, and invented several openings, 
 including lines in the Sicilian and King Indian's Defense that are still

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Tigran Petrosian was born in Tbilisi, Georgia. Both his parents died when he 
 was 16 years old. He took work in an officer's club to maintain his family 
 and found chess to be his main consolation. The play and principles of 
 Capablanca and Nimzowitsch influenced his early development. In 1963, he 
 wrested the world title crown from Botvinnik, which took two months, and then 
 defended it against Spassky in 1966. He later lost his title to Spassky in 
 1969. Petrosian was content to draw with most of his rivals but he was almost 
 impossible to beat due to his extreme prophylactic play.

 [SYLE]
 The unique defensive bent makes the Petrosian-style not terribly popular for 
 many fans, though connoisseurs might find subtle features to savor. This 
 personality excels in closed, constricted positions, snuffing out attacks 
 even before foes begin to mobilize their forces, and shuns sharp lines in 
 favor the Caro-Kann and French Defense.

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Born in Summerville, South Carolina, Harry Nelson Pillsbury learned chess at 
 16 and was one of the few great masters content to make it his profession. 
 His blindfold powers and miraculous memory were a delight to behold. During 
 simultaneous exhibitions of chess and checkers he would ask someone to submit 
 a list of 30 words which he repeated backwards when he was all through. In 
 1895 he sailed to Europe and startled the world by winning Hastings ahead of 
 all the leading players of his day -- but his first success was to be his 
 greatest. Always a tough contender, only once again did he share first in an 
 international tournament at Munich 1900. Poor health plagued his play, and he 
 died prematurely at 34.

 Vigorous and combinative, the Pillsbury-style is particualrly adept at 
 Queen's Gambit and Ruy Lopez, two major weapons of the modern master. When

 to excel at chess. She achieved the title at 15 and became the highest rated 
 female in history before breaking into the top ten by winning a 10-game 
 training match against Spassky in 1992. In 1998 she also beat Karpov 5-3 at a 
 fast time limit of 25 minutes per side. She fought her way to the top by 
 competing only in mixed events despite dogged resistance from Communist chess 
 officials in her own country who tried to confine her and her two sisters to 
 women's tournaments.

 The Polgar-style is characterized by aggression, almost invariably opening 
 with 1. e4 and striving for the initiative right from the start. However, 
 this personality is far from reckless, and is a tough tournament competitor, 
 winning a lot of points from beautiful combinations.

(  RESHEVSKY  )
 '-----------'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Samuel Reshevsky, born in Ozorkow, Poland, was a famous child prodigy who 
 started touring the world at age 6 giving simultaneous displays. He quit 
 playing after his family settled in America to complete his education and 
 become an accountant. Upon returning to the international arena, he won 
 Margate in 1935 ahead of Capablanca and captured the USA Championship in 1936 
 and remained a contender for the title into the late 1970s.

 [SYLE]
 The Reshevsky-style is weaker in openings than many of the GM-style opponents 
 in Chessmaster 10th Edition, and is very much at home in cramped positions. 
 This personality is partial to 1. d4 and often defends with the Nimzo-Indian, 
 but is also strong in endgames and has superb tactical skill.

(  RETI  )

 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Richard Reti was born in Pezinok (in Hungary at the time) and earned his 
 living writing chess columns and giving simultaneous displays. In 1925 he 
 played 29 blindfold games at once, then a record. His results were always 
 good -- he broke Capablanca's eight year winning streak by beating him at New 
 York 1924 -- but he was never a contender. Today he is best remembered for 
 writing two classics 'Masters of the Chessboard' and 'Modern Ideas in Chess'.

 [SYLE]
 Another Hypermodern school devotee, the Reti-style in Chessmaster 10th 
 Edition rarely occupies the center directly. Among this personality's 
 openings are, appropriately, Reti's Opening (1. Nf3), Alekhine's Defense (1. 
 e4 Nf6), and Fianchetto formations like 1. g3 and 2. Bg2.

(  RUBINSTEIN  )
 '------------'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 The youngest of 12 children, Akiba Rubinstein was born in Stawiski, a Polish 
 border town then in Russia. He learned chess at 16 and devoted his life to 
 the game, remaining one of the top four until after WWI. He might have become 
 world champion, but being a poor Jewish person from the ghetto never got 
 backing for a shot at the title. His greatest victory came at Carlsbad 1907 
 with everyone there except Lasker, then by a tie for first with Lasker (whom 
 he beat) at St. Petersburg 1909. Rubinstein's last hurrah came at Vienna 
 1922. A lifelong shyness developed into a persecution complex. 'There is 
 scarcely another master who suffers so from nerves, which cause him moments 
 of complete exhaustion so that he commits crude blunders,' noted Reti.

 [SYLE]
 For accuracy in endgames, it is hard to do better than the Rubinstein-style. 
 Although strong in openings, this personality prefers simplifications and 
 quiet lines without complications.

(  SEIRAWAN  )
 '----------'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Yasser Seirawan was born in Damascus, Syria, but lived in the USA since age 
 2. He became world junior champion in 1979, then won Wijk aan Zee in 1980. He 
 tied for first with Browne in the 1981 USA Championship, which he won by 
 himself in 1986. After defeating two reigning world champions (Karpov and 
 Kasparov) in individual games, a dispute with chess officials over the way 
 they picked Olympic teams soured him on playing. In 1988 Seirawan started a 
 new venture as editor and publisher of 'Inside Chess', gradually turning his 
 talents toward the business side of the game. Today he competes infrequently.

 [SYLE]
 The Seirawan-style is basically defensive, with a highly refined positional 
 style that shines in the endgame. This personality is fond of the Caro-Kann 
 Defense and is very tough with Black.


 .--------.
(  SHIROV  )
 '--------'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Alexei Shirov was born in Riga, Latvia, and has remained in the world's top 
 ten ever since he was 20. Due to problems with his country's chess officials 
 and after losing his life savings when a bank failed, he emigrated to Spain 
 'because I already spoke some Spanish'. His presence on their Olympic team in 
 1996 helped Spain finish sixth in a field of over 100 nations, a sensational 
 result. Shirov got his big break at Linares in 1998 as runner-up to Anand, 
 whom he then replaced in a match with Kramnik where victory earned him a $2 
 million title shot against Kasparov. 

 [SYLE]
 The Shirov-style is essentially exciting chess that doesn't shrink from risk 
 at any time in the game. This personality has an ability to find moves that 
 may not be best but which often unnerve the opponent.


 .-------.
(  SHORT  )
 '-------'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY] 
 Nigel Short was born in Leigh, England, and became the youngest player tO 
 achieve the International Master title by age 15, when he was runner-up to 
 Kasparov in the World Junior. In 1993, after winning preliminary matches 
 against the likes of Timman and Karpov, he became the first Western 
 challenger for the title since Bobby Fischer in 1972. Dissatisfied with FIDE, 
 however, he and Kasparov broke away to form the rival PCA. The Times of 
 London put up a purse of $2.5 million, and the fascinating story of their 
 historic confrontation is reported by Dominic Lawson in 'Endgame' (Harmony 
 Books 1994).

 [SYLE]
 True to its natural attacking roots, the Short-style usually opens with 1. 
 e4, playing for open positions and attacking lines. Though this personality 
 will achieve brilliant wins against some of the best, it is also prone to 
 horrible defeats to lesser players, because of an inability to compromise its 
 style.

(  SMYLOV  )
 '--------'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Vassily Smyslov was born in Moscow, USSR. Chess nearly lost him when he 
 narrowly failed an audition as a singer with the Bolshoi Opera in 1950. He 
 then faced Botvinnik in three title matches with an overall score of 18 wins, 
 17 losses and 34 draws. Smyslov drew their first match in 1954, won the 
 second in 1957 and became world champion for a year before dropping a rematch 
 in 1958. In his heyday he was nearly invincible, and his amazing longevity 
 was demonstrated in 1984 when at age 63 he became the oldest player to reach 
 the finals where he was dispatched by Kasparov.

 [SYLE]
 The Smyslov-style combines the best of old and new ideas with a serene, 
 simple and powerful brand of chess. As White, this personality favors the 
 English and is equally at home in flank openings or classical defenses.


 .---------.
(  SPASSKY  )
 '---------'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Boris Spassky was born in Leningrad, USSR. He became world junior champion in 
 1955 and went on to capture the crown from Petrosian. Spassky reigned as 
 world champion from 1969-72. His dramatic match with Fischer at Reykjavik in 
 1972 captured headlines all over the globe. Spassky disobeyed orders to 
 return home and sportingly continued playing after he amassed a two-point 
 lead when Fischer failed to show up for their second game. However, Spassky 
 could not withstand Fischer's fierce onslaught and although he fought 
 valiantly, lost his title. Soviet authorities punished him for losing to an 
 American. He eventually moved to France to play on their Olympic team. In 
 1992 he again faced Fischer for a record purse of $5 million and again he 
 lost.

 [SYLE]
 A universal talent comfortable in virtually any position, the Spassky-style 
 has a flair for lively tactics. As Black, this personality plays the Tarrasch 
 Defense and as White the Leningrad Variation of the Nimzo-Indian.


 .----------.
(  STEINITZ  )
 '----------'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Wilhelm Steinitz was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia. He learned chess at the 
 age of 12; unable to afford a board and men, he made his own. He went to 
 Vienna as a young man and first attempted to earn a living as a journalist 
 before dedicating his vocation to chess. He held the first official world 
 championship from 1886-94, it was the 25 year old Lasker who eventually de-
 throned him. He earned a living as a chess pro in London, then the Mecca of 
 the chess world, before emigrating to America where he died in poverty.

 [SYLE]
 The antithesis of the romantic era of chess, the Steinitz-style is the 
 forerunner of modern positional play. This personality is quite at home in 
 the closed game with barricaded pawn structures, and will even move its king 
 in the opening to gain material.


 .-----.
(  TAL  )
 '-----'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Mikhail Tal was born in Riga, Latvia, and swiftly received international 
 acclaim with his fearless and imaginative attacks. Full of nervous energy, 
 chain-smoking, pacing restlessly between moves, he was obsessed with chess 
 and played fast games against all comers into the wee hours. He was world 
 champion for only one year after beating Botvinnik in 1960 but lost the 
 rematch in 1961. Although plagued with ill-health, Tal always remained a 
 favorite with the fans. His witty book 'The Life And Games Of Mikhail Tal' 
 (1976) is a classic that will be enjoyed by future generations.

 [SYLE]
 While talented in all facets of the game, the Tal-style loves mayhem. All 
 this personality needs is a chance to attack and the position will explode in 
 fireworks.


 .----------.
(  TARRASCH  )
 '----------'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Siegbert Tarrasch, born in Breslau, Germany, was a medical doctor and one of 
 the world's four best players (along with Steinitz, Lasker and Chigorin) for 
 about 20 years until he lost a title match to Lasker in 1908. He occupies a 
 unique position in chess literature and today is remembered chiefly as a 
 great chess teacher. His word was law. Uniting the theories of Morphy and 
 Steinitz, he preached the value of mobility and rapid development. 

 [SYLE]
 An apostle of the attack, the Tarrasch-style will patiently accumulate small 
 advantages until they add up to a big bang. This personality champions the 
 Open Defense to the Ruy Lopez and the Tarrasch Defense, where the mobility of 
 Black's pieces balance the isolated queen pawn.


 .------------.
(  TARTAKOWER  )
 '------------'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Saveilly Tartakower was a bit of an anomaly in the chess world of the early 
 20th century. While he could attack when needed, Tartakower could defend as 
 well, and was perfectly happy to embrace many of the new ideas of the 
 Hypermodern chess movement. Known as one of the leading exponents of openings 
 theory, Tartakower ironically lost one of the most famous chess miniatures 
 ever played against Richard Reti, in only 10 moves (see this Classic Game in 
 the Chessmaster Library). 

 [SYLE]
 The Tartakower-style will usually try to use superior opening preparation to 
 build up an early advantage, that can later be exploited either positionally 
 or tactically. This personality plays a wide range of openings for both White 
 and Black.


 .--------.
(  TIMMAN  )
 '--------'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Jan Timman won his national title on numerous occasions starting in 1974, 
 thus inheriting the mantle of Holland's best player from Euwe and then 
 Donner. He has beaten all reigning world champs in individual games and has 
 always had fine results, including Mar Del Plata 1982 -- first ahead of 
 Karpov by two full points. In 1993 he dropped a FIDE title match to Karpov 
 and turned his attention to chess journalism. Today Timman is best known as 
 the editor of New In Chess.

 [SYLE]
 The Timman-style is well versed in the openings and generally plays in a 
 flexible but muscular manner. Over the years, this personality has blended 
 deep theoretical knowledge, and a direct classical approach.

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 New York City native Josh Waitzkin discovered chess at the age of six. 
 Captivated by the local version of 'speed chess', Josh immediately began a 
 serious study of the game. As a scholastic competitor, Josh won 8 national 
 titles, and his youthful career was immortalized in the book and subsequent 
 film, 'Searching for Bobby Fischer'. Josh became a National Master at age 13, 
 an International Master at 16, and an acclaimed chess author at 18, with 
 'Attacking Chess'. One of the most popular and widely recognized chess 
 players in the world, Josh has gained a reputation for the humanistic grace 
 with which he speaks and writes about the art. In addition to his extensive 
 chess pursuits, Josh also studies Eastern Philosophy and Religion, and has 
 become deeply immersed in the study of Tai Chi Chuan with Grandmaster William 
 CC Chen. Josh has already added 4 Tai Chi Chuan Push Hands National 
 Championship titles to his 8 National Chess Championship titles.

 [SYLE]
 The Waitzkin-style is known for fearless attacks and deep understanding of 
 the endgame.

(  ZUKERTORT  )
 '-----------'
 [RATING]
 2700

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Zukertort began as a student of Anderssen, and by 1871, had become the 
 second-best player in the world. Zukertort lost two matches for the world 
 championship to Steinitz in 1872 (+1 -7 =4) and again in 1886 (+5 -10 =5). 
 His greatest success came at London 1883, three points ahead of Steinitz. 
 Blessed with a prodigious memory, Zukertort could recall countless games and 
 variations, a trait that served him well as co-editor of the Neue Berliner 
 Schachzeitung. In many ways, Zukertort was the Baron Munchausen of chess. In 
 a fanciful account of his early life, he claimed fluency in nine languages, 
 and boasted of being a crack pistol shot, an accomplished swordsman, and a 
 veteran of military campaigns he never fought in. One witness overheard him 
 holding a visitor from India spellbound with a convincing and detailed 
 description of a tiger hunt he never took part in. He was seized by a stroke 
 while playing at London's famous Simpson's Divan and died the next day.

 [SYLE]
 With the exception of occasional experiments with 1.Nf3, it is hard to find 
 any of games from the Zukertort-style that varied from the staunch 1. e4 e5 
 with either White or Black. This personality will generally plant firmly in 
 the center and slug it out in open games.

 talk over a chessboard. Frederic's skill as a chess player is somewhat 
 renowned and players travel from neighboring villages to challenge him. Most 
 often, he wins.

 [SYLE]
 Frederic is a very strong 2629-rated player who plays a balanced game. He 
 prefers to play openings that were popular in the early 20th century.

 matches with her older brother and friends. In recent years she has taken 
 great pleasure in providing chess tutelage to her granddaughter, who is now 
 recognized as an up-and-coming female player.

 [RATING]
 2415

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 A lumberjack in the deep woods of Alaska, Sven is a champion log-roller and 
 tobacco spitter. During the long northern winters he keeps his wits sharp by 
 playing chess against himself. When the weather is good he and his big dog 
 Lucy like to go into town for some R&R. While Lucy plays with the other sled 
 dogs, Sven takes to the local tavern and wagers games of chess for tankards 
 of ale. By the end of the night he has usually clear-cut the competition and 
 is a bit tipsy. Emma, the friendly barmaid, lets him sleep it off before his 
 sled-trek back to his cabin.

 [SYLE]
 Sven likes to play as many games as possible in a night (more games = more 
 beer) so look for him to be pretty aggressive. He likes to chop down material 
 quickly and then whittle away at the endgame.

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 A leading female chess player in the '60s, Lou stopped playing competitively 
 to raise her two sons and pursue her law degree. She rarely plays these days, 
 as neither her husband nor her sons provide much of a challenge to her 
 abilities. However, she recently discovered the joy of playing chess on-line 
 and from time to time logs on under the name 'Queen of Torts'.

 [SYLE]
 Lou is a natural player who has made it a point to ignore conventional 
 opening theory, believing that it keeps her game from becoming stagnant. She 
 attacks each opening position with an open mind. Her rating is 2367.

(  JINX  )
 '------'
 [RATING]
 2337

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Jinx is the youngest in her chess-playing family with five older brothers, 
 two of whom are chess champions. Jinx got her nickname by the fact that, 
 whenever she attends a tournament in which one of her brothers plays, he 
 always loses early in the competition. She has learned to play chess in much 
 the same manner as she plays other competitive sports like 'one of the guys'.

 [SYLE]
 Jinx is a strong 2337-rated player, but she tends to neglect the mobility of 
 her own pieces, controlling the center, and her own pawn structure.

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Lili works for an advertising agency. She started to play chess late in her

 workaholics, they always have a chess game ongoing. They play most often in 
 the morning, after breakfast, before heading for work. They also play 
 sometimes early in the evening, before watching TV.

 [SYLE]
 Lili's opening book knowledge is extensive but she seems to prefer lines that 
 put her at a slight disadvantage. She places a high premium on controlling 
 the center. Her rating is 2275.

(  BUCK  )
 '------'
 [RATING]
 2238

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Buck is a long distance truck driver who occupies his time on long journeys 
 by carrying on chess games with other truckers over CB radios. Anyone 
 listening in to one of their transmissions is likely to be confused as they 
 use their own trucker lingo for pieces and square moves. ('Elvis spotted at 
 the second house, over,' translates to Kh2.) Playing this way has honed his 
 ability to think through long strategies and picture tactics in his mind.

 [SYLE]
 Buck prefers openings that involve a lot of captures. His key weakness is his 
 almost total disregard for controlling the center. In spite of this, his 
 rating is a strong 2238.

(  J.T.  )
 '------'
 [RATING]
 2214

 J.T. attended the finest prep schools as a teenager, where chess was offered 
 as part of the curriculum. Though naturally talented at the game, he never 
 developed the passion needed to propel him from 'very good' status to the 
 status of greatness. Though he hasn't played much in recent years, he can 
 usually sit down and pick up where he left off, instantly playing as well as 
 he did in his teen years.

 [SYLE]
 J.T. plays opening specifically designed to entice the opponent into falling 
 into one of a number of specific traps that he has prepared for. He is rated 
 2214.

 combination of chess and computers and buys the best and latest version of 
 Chessmaster as soon as it hits the stores. Because of his long hours working 
 on a computer screen, he often indulges in chess matches on-line.

 [SYLE]
 Muldoon's play is designed to get to the endgame with a superiority of pawns 
 and he is adept at exploiting passed pawns. His weakness is that he sometimes 
 trades away minor pieces for the pawn superiority. He is rated 2203.

 occasionally played in tournaments throughout her teen years, and often 
 placed in the top ten finalists. Jade is currently pursuing her Ph.D. in 
 Eastern Philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley.

 [SYLE]
 Jade is a strong player with solid opening theory and a rating of 2178. The

 often pass up attacking opportunities and retreat, waiting for her opponent 
 to initiate the attack.

 grandfather's record, who won five chess tournaments in a single year.

 A veterinarian in rural Arizona, Doc has maintained a correspondence chess 
 competition with an old college buddy currently living in Florida. Since both 
 players know the other's idiosyncrasies and playing styles so well, they are 
 constantly trying to out-maneuver each other with new techniques and ideas.

 Wally is a Midwestern farmer who meets with other farmers every Friday at the 
 local coffee shop where they engage in games of chess, bridge, or pinochle. 
 During the winter he and other chess lovers are likely to meet more 
 frequently, often spending long afternoons challenging each other to matches.

 [SYLE]
 Wally's opening moves lull the opponent into expecting a long game, but then 
 Wally shifts gears and starts trading pieces quickly. Wally's primary 
 weakness is the fact that he values queens and rooks the same. Given this 
 peculiarity, it is remarkable that he has been able to maintain a 2003 
 rating.

 '---------------'
 [RATING]
 2100

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 By the time Josh Waitzkin was 12 he had already won many national titles and 
 was widely recognized as America's strongest young player. In a simultaneous 
 exhibition at age 11, Josh drew a game against World Champion Garry Kasparov, 
 an unprecedented feat for a boy so young. However, Josh encountered his first 
 plateau at age 12 as his rating hovered around 2170 for over a year. Finally, 
 a few days after turning 13 he broke through and his rating quickly shot up 
 to 2400. Josh learned that even the fiercest competitor must exhibit patience 
 while his game grows.

 [SYLE]
 Josh had become a more rounded player at age 12, with a rating of 2100. His 
 love for the endgame was complemented by a strong opening repertoire and his 
 desire to attack was grounded in objectivity. His personality was very 
 aggressive and it came across on the board. Closed maneuvering games and 
 positional nuance went against his grain.

 Porsche salesman, Dobie's wealthy girlfriend, Buffy, is teaching him the game 
 so he can compete with her Mummy and Daddy during weekend getaways at their 
 Long Island Estate.

 [SYLE]
 Dobie's 1977 rating puts him in the category of a strong intermediate / weak 
 advanced player. He slightly prefers playing for material in exchange for 
 positional strength.

 in the evenings when prayers and chores are done for the day. Though 
 aggressive play is officially frowned upon, matches often become quite 
 spirited, and Rand secretly takes great pride in the fact that he often wins.

 [SYLE]
 Rand is an all-around balanced player. His opportunities for long study have 
 resulted in a deep knowledge of opening moves. He is rated 1972.

 actress seriously. She used the money to pay for her economic studies and 
 aims to become a real business woman in a few years. As part of her self-
 education, Laura took to chess and discovered she is a natural talent.

 [SYLE]
 As her rating indicates, Laura is a strong intermediate player, which is the 
 more outstanding as she plays chess for less than a couple hours each week. 
 Her most obvious default is underestimating bishops.

(  RICK  )
 '------'
 [RATING]
 1905

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Rick is an up-and-coming model who likes to relax at photography shoots by 
 inviting models, set designers, hair stylists, etc., into chess competitions. 
 Because of his pretty-boy/party boy reputation, his new opponents don't tend 
 to take him very seriously. They soon find out that he's a very good player.

 [SYLE]
 Rick prefers gambit openings and has a slight preference of knights over 
 bishops. He is also adept at exploiting passed pawns. He is rated 1905.

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Roxy is the lead singer in a rock band that tours the country 250 days each 
 year. During the band's long bus journeys, chess is one of the activities 
 used to occupy their time. As the only female on the bus, Roxy enjoys the 
 fact that she almost always beats everybody else at the game.

 [SYLE]
 On the whole, Roxy's play is balanced. She does have a liking for the more 
 unorthodox openings. She is a strong-intermediate 1847-rated player.

(  VLAD  )
 '------'
 [RATING]
 1846

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Vlad is a Russian-born physicist who emigrated from his native country to the 
 United States to be able to work on non-defense applications. Like many 
 Russians of his generation, he learned chess in school as a young boy. In the 
 United States, Vlad has used his expertise at chess to help him make friends 
 and overcome language barriers.

 [SYLE]
 Vlad's favorite tactic is to play so quickly that his opponents try to match 
 his speedy pace regardless of what's on their clocks. Vlad's rating of 1846 
 is quite respectable considering the fact that he never thinks about a move 
 more than a second. The key to defeating Vlad is patience, patience, 
 patience.

(  JESSICA  )
 '---------'
 [RATING]
 1845

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Jessica is a very promising young chess player who is coached by her father 
 and feels a lot of pressure to succeed. Playing almost every day since the 
 age of five has taken a toll on Jessica's social life and she has recently 
 begun to rebel against her father's dreams. She sometimes plays erratically, 
 even losing on purpose so that the lesson can be over and she can go to the 
 mall.

 [SYLE]
 Jessica prefers openings involving a lot of pawn moves. Although her rating 
 is a strong 1845, she overvalues pawns to the degree that she will often 
 trade a pawn for a minor piece.

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 A preacher in the bible belt, Luke is known for his powerful fire and 
 brimstone sermons. Among the parishioners with whom he plays chess, he's also 
 known for his fire and brimstone style of playing chess. Don't even think of 
 messing with his bishops.

 [SYLE]
 Luke is an intermediate player with a respectable 1944 rating. The key to 
 defeating him is to exploit his love of bishops by enticing him to trade his 
 rooks for your bishops.

(  RUSTY  )
 '-------'
 [RATING]
 1831

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 A cowboy and rodeo clown, Rusty has managed to find steady employment in the 
 ranchlands of Wyoming. As a ten-year-old boy Rusty learned to play chess from 
 his father. Though he no longer plays chess, he has fond memories of the time 
 spent with his father.

 [SYLE]
 Even though he hasn't played in awhile, Rusty's 1831 rating is quite 
 respectable. He prefers bishops over knights and he almost completely ignores 
 positional play.

(  TURK  )
 '------'
 [RATING]
 1815

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 A native New Yorker, Turk was raised on the mean streets and learned to play 
 chess at a local boy's club. Thus saved from a life of crime, Turk is 
 nonetheless a street hustler, occasionally selling discount wares, but mostly 
 eking out a living by challenging all comers to speed chess matches, $5.00 a 
 game, in Washington Square.

(  JOSH - AGE 9  )
 '--------------'
 [RATING]
 1800

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Josh Waitzkin won his first National Championship at age nine, which became 
 the basis for the book and film 'Searching For Bobby Fischer'. He would later 
 say that this victory was the most important in his life because it taught 
 him that hard work pays off and that he should never give up. Since losing 
 the year before he had studied long hours and had developed a feel for the 
 end game unusual for a boy so young. He was already becoming a complete 
 player rated around 1800 and competing almost exclusively against adults, he 
 could slash through a tactical melee or eke out a win in an even end game.

 [SYLE]
 At age 9 Josh was very sharp tactically and got stronger as the game moved 
 along. His opening knowledge still lagged behind but he would later explain 
 that this was very good for his future growth as a player. Studying the 
 openings is just memorizing moves, hoping for traps, but studying the endgame 
 is learning about chess. His rating was 1800.

(  TONI  )
 '------'
 [RATING]
 1787

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 A receptionist at a high-class law firm, Toni often finds herself to be bored 
 between the inevitable crises and pressures of her job. After exhausting 
 every game of solitaire and hangman she could find, she started playing chess 
 on her computer at work. Toni learned to play from her father, so her moments 
 with the game tend to bring back fond memories for her.

 [SYLE]
 Toni is affectionately referred to as the 'pawngrabber' because of her 
 penchant for trading her minor pieces for enemy pawns. Not all opponents can 
 exploit this weakness, as evidenced by her high 1787 rating.

(  KENJI  )
 '-------'
 [RATING]
 1757

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 The long lost son of an honored samurai, Kenji took up chess knowing that it 
 was a game his father enjoyed and that the game serves as a connection to his 
 deceased father. He works as a professor of mathematics and enjoys collecting 
 samurai swords.

 [SYLE]
 Each match is a battle to him and he takes pride in the decisive blows that 
 he deals to his opponents. He covets his knights because they symbolize 
 courage of samurais.

(  LIAM  )
 '------'
 [RATING]
 1739

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 A former CIA operative, Liam learned chess as part of his cover in the Soviet 
 Union. He rose high in the ranks of the 'Secret Scythe' chess organization 
 that was the backbone of the Soviet Chess machine in the '80s. Liam began to 
 manifest 'identity problems' in the late '80s as the Soviet Union began to 
 collapse. After one devastating loss, Liam swore to 'destroy the chess 
 world', and defected to Cuba. New reports, however, claim that he is a 
 homeless outcast, playing for pesos on street corners and alleyways, and not 
 always winning.

 [SYLE]
 Liam always opens with 1. d4 as white, and will aim for the Queen's Gambit. 
 He defends with either the Caro-Kann or the Pirc against 1. e4, and will 
 reply Nf6 to 1. d4, aiming for the Grunfeld Defense as black. As white, Liam 
 is a relentless attacker, as black, a stubborn defender.

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Tick's got his nickname after his other favourite pasttime: fixing watches. 
 Or, as his lovely wife says, 'dismantling perfectly working items in order to 
 pretend repairing them'. His leading hobby is chess, though, and during every 
 lunch break he battles it out over the Internet, making friends with people 
 from exotic places - he pretends his last opponent was an Eskimo.

 [SYLE]
 Tick's games are anything but boring; he's very mobile and likes to control 
 the game.

(  T.C.  )
 '------'
 [RATING]
 1701

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 T.C. was found as a baby on the shores of Pittsburg Landing, near the 
 battlefield museum commemorating the battle of Shiloh. While still a small 
 child, T.C. had the eerie ability to correctly recite the exploits of obscure 
 Civil War generals. As he grew older, T.C. turned his attention from 19th-
 century military campaigns to the strategic possibilities offered by a 64-
 square battlefield. Like his 19th-century chess idols, T.C.'s penchant for 
 wild and woolly play made for some strange results, as in one high school 
 tournament where he lost all of his games with White and won all his games 
 with Black. T.C. will likely never win an event at any level, but his play is 
 generally anything but boring.

 [SYLE]
 T.C. doesn't like playing against other players' prepared lines. So he 
 prefers unusual openings, often surprising opponents with Bird's Opening as 
 White or the Dutch against d4. T.C. will attack more often than defend, 
 especially if he can corner an enemy king or secure a passed pawn with a 
 well-timed sacrifice. However, T.C.'s endgame technique is suspect (probably 
 leading to his rating of 1701). T.C.'s games are marked by mobility -- hardly 
 a surprise, since his favorite player is Paul Morphy.

 grossing movie and years as head writer for a number-one television show. 
 Now living off of residuals, Dave spends his days gardening, playing chess, 
 and walking his dogs, Larry, Moe and Curly.

 come from out of nowhere). He is rated 1674.

 [RATING]
 1759

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Nikolai is a physics professor at a prestigious European college. He is a 
 tough taskmaster, and students have to work hard to receive merely a passing 
 grade. Nonetheless, students flock to his classes, as everyone knows that, 
 once they've taken his class, their understanding of physics will be well-
 grounded, and their academic background will be given prestige. During his 
 rare time off, Nikolai teaches chess, and is an equally demanding teacher on 
 the chessboard.

 [SYLE]
 Nikolai's weakness is his pawns. He gets so wrapped up in calculating 
 complicated combinations that he neglects the safety of his pawns. He is 
 rated 1759.

 working a couple years for a famous publishing house, she settled on working 
 as a librarian - now she's got all the poetry she can handle, and for free...

 [SYLE]
 Odile fell in love with the poetry of chess after reading an Omar Khayyam 
 book. As she likes the delicate look of the bishops in her porcelain chess 
 set, she learned how to use them efficiently. Watch out for her pins and 
 skewers!

(  SLICK  )
 '-------'
 [RATING]
 1625

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 A child prodigy in math, Slick took up chess when he concluded that it was a 
 strictly mathematical game. As in math, he developed his own shortcuts for 
 solving many chess problems. Slick will play anyone at any time, and plays 
 just for the fun of it. All games are challenging to him, as every game is 
 different. Slick was given his nickname because of his tendency to leave his 
 pieces as mobile as possible.

 [SYLE]
 Slick likes to get the Queens off the board because they greatly increase the 
 mathematical possibilities. He is generally reckless in situations with which 
 he isn't familiar, but keeps his pieces mobile. He's very knowledgeable on 
 the Sicilian defense. He will often take a draw, as tying is mathematically 
 better than losing.

(  WALDO  )
 '-------'
 [RATING]
 1618

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 A professional courier of sensitive documents for the Pentagon, Waldo spends 
 over 50% of every week on an airplane, travelling to some exotic locale. To 
 his sky-high seatmates, he often represents his job as being that of a secret 
 agent. Because he meets dozens of new people every week, he's seldom at a 
 loss for a new chess opponent to challenge on his magnetic travel set. 
 Waldo's story of being a secret agent backfired on him when he sat next to 
 Liam on a Moscow/New York flight.

 [SYLE]
 Waldo is a solid player (1717) who likes to offer material in the opening 
 game in exchange for development. He will typically trade his bishops away 
 for enemy knights.

(  JOSH - AGE 8  )
 '--------------'
 [RATING]
 1600

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Josh Waitzkin started playing in adult tournaments when he was 8 years old. 
 Though this was frustrating in many ways, he found that his games against 
 adults gave him an edge when competing against kids. He played for the 
 national title for the first time at 8 and was sure he would win but fell 
 for an opening trap and lost in the last round. David Arnett, the kid that 
 beat him, would later become his best friend and a chess master. Josh would 
 later describe that loss as the most painful and greatest moment in his chess 
 life. 'Talent is cheap,' he would come to reflect, 'You have to put in the 
 work'.

 [SYLE]
 Openings were still the weakest part of Josh's game. Playing 6-hour 
 tournament games against adults, he learned that playing for traps usually 
 doesn't work against tough opponents. His Washington Square Park style was 
 evolving. Positional ideas were flowing into tactics and the endgame. His 
 rating was 1600.

 George is known as 'The Singing Dentist'. An operatic baritone, George likes 
 to sing while he works and (most of) his patients actually find it relaxing 
 when he sings. Usually, he sings opera or popular music (and occasionally 
 takes requests), but when he works on children, he sings songs he made up 
 about Mr. Tooth, Mr. Drill, and Madame Rinse and Spit. George really enjoys 
 chess and plays on-line whenever he gets the chance.

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 If asked to name his favorite historical figure, Jon would probably say Pablo 
 Picasso or Leonardo DaVinci. Jon is quite a good artist in his own right, 
 and carries a sketchbook with him wherever he goes. This has occasionally 
 gotten him into trouble in school, where he is often reprimanded for 
 sketching the teacher's portrait rather than listening to the lesson. Jon's 
 best friend from childhood turned out to be a science nut and the thing the 
 two friends still have in common is their love of chess.

 dirt. Though he doesn't play chess often, he always joins in at get-togethers 
 of his large extended family, where everybody, from the wisest elder to the 
 squirmiest child, plays chess and discusses moves and strategies.

 [SYLE]
 Max enjoys the drama of ultra-blitz chess even when the time controls don't 
 call for it. His speedy play can be intimidating to his opponents, and his 
 tactics are good. The key to defeating him is to look for holes in his 
 strategic play. He is rated 1588.

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Hans lives in the Swiss Alps and leads ski tours in the winter and hiking

 hot buttered rum and a good book or a game of chess. With his charming 
 personality and handsome appeal, Hans is a favorite with the ladies.

 always placed a high value on intellectual pursuits, and taught all of their 
 children to play chess at an early age.

 A sensitive eye doubled by a pragmatic mind, Michael dropped school to launch 
 his own animation company. At first, things were bad - he practically 
 survived on black tea and peanut butter sandwiches. However, his first 
 computer animated video (a funny battle between some neglected chess pieces 
 in an attic) proved a winner. Since then, Michael decided chess means good 
 luck to him, and started wearing a knight suspended by a silver chain.

 [SYLE]
 Michael seems to be very good at chess, even if he doesn't spend too much 
 time playing. He likes to draw instead of fighting long boring endgames.

 skills while still maintaining a normal life. He and his father frequently 
 have long, heated matches, which Dylan has, from time to time, begun to win.

 lose when it's a wise business decision to do so. Ginger's new favorite 
 phrase is 'Let's do chess'.

 [SYLE]
 Ginger likes to test her adversaries by offering opportunities in the opening

 quite good at the game, though she tends to play fairly technically, ignoring 
 her intuition altogether.

 [SYLE]
 Cal plays King's pawn openings exclusively and prefers open games and 
 reducing material on the board. Watch out for sacrifices (sometimes ill-

 [RATING]
 1365

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Josh Waitzkin started working with renowned chess coach Bruce Pandolfini when 
 he was 7 years old. Their early study focused on the end game and Josh soon 
 became very confident in this crucial part of the struggle. In his first 
 tournament games, Josh often found himself down a pawn or a piece but would 
 fight back and usually finesse a win in the end game. Bruce started calling 
 Josh 'Tiger' because of his attacking style and the name caught on at 
 Washington Square Park in New York City, where he often played. Josh was a 
 1400 player when he was 7, stronger than half the tournament players in the 
 country.

 [SYLE]
 At seven, Josh he was studying the endgame and middlegame. Openings were his 
 weakness. Rated at 1365, Josh was a tough fighter, clawed his way out of 
 trouble, and earned the nickname 'Tiger'. He would sometimes trade into worse 
 endgames and then try to win - a two-edged-sword.

 everything he owned into storage and moved to Australia, although it is 
 certain that he is still making friends and playing chess regularly.

 his true calling as a bartender. Never a serious student of chess, Will plays 
 logically, but often comes up short in the endgame.

 hire. He stumbled on some old chess books in a used bookstore, and became an 
 immediate fan, committing entire classic chess games to memory.

 [SYLE]
 For Krycek, the way to get ahead in chess is to memorize everything. He 
 prefers older openings to newer, 'unproven' ones, and is solid in the

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Josh Waitzkin learned to play chess in Washington Square Park in New York 
 City when he was 6 years old. His early teachers were old retired men and 
 chess hustlers, tough players who moved the pieces trying to eke out a 
 living. Josh was a gifted tactician and a fierce competitor, perfect for the 
 park, and his games always attracted a crowd. In games against seasoned 
 players he would sometimes seem to fall into a zone. His mother would say 
 that when he sat down at the chess board the little boy went away and an old 
 man came to play.

 [SYLE]
 As a 6-year-old Josh was pure aggression. Rated at 1200, Josh didn't know 
 much about positional subtleties or opening theory, but when the game got 
 messy he was dangerous. Josh liked to bring his queen out early and to set 
 traps. In the heat of attack, Josh tended to overlook his own king safety.

 can't decide between them, and usually drops a coin to see what to do next: 
 play soccer on his computer or watch movies. He likes trying new things, but 
 this usually means he will need to spend even more time dropping coins. After 
 watching a news report about the Fischer/Spassky rematch, he decided chess is 
 cool and added it to his hobby list.

 On the chess board, Orin is just as undecided as in real life. He's defensive

 Jeff occasionally enjoys a game of chess. And, having an efficient and quick 
 analytical mind, he is pretty good for a novice. He doesn't take the game 
 seriously enough to put in the same amount of study and research that he puts 
 into learning Java and other web languages, however.

 [SYLE]
 Jeff is a natural player (rated 1133), who has a reasonable understanding of

 ever and she found new friends. Not to mention the enchanting scenery...

 [SYLE]
 One of the few old habits she's still allowing herself is playing chess 
 online (actually, she's more chatting than playing, but her playing strength 
 has improved lately). Ella has a very defensive attitude and plays very 
 carefully; however, she tends to neglect pawn development.

 [RATING]
 949

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Eddie has written his first comic when he was six, but gave up the dream of 
 being an author in favor of collecting comic books and writing reviews for 
 his small web site. His hobby doesn't pay, so he teaches computer science at 
 the local college. His favourite comic writer is Scott McCloud, and after 
 reading about his obsession with chess, he learned the game and plays it now 
 and then.

 [SYLE]
 If there's a chess piece Eddie is uncomfortable with, that's the knight. He 
 tries to get rid of his opponent's knights as soon as possible, and holds his 
 rooks and queen in high esteem. That's why he's only rated 949.

 culture. She has found that playing chess is often a good way to untie 
 tongues...

(  KENDRA  )
 '--------'
 [RATING]

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 Kendra is a teenager who loves to cook, or to be more accurate, she loves to 
 bake. Whether it's lasagna, or cookies, or double chocolate hazelnut torte, 
 Kendra is an expert at making good things come from the oven. Perhaps this 
 is due to the fact that her mother is a terrible cook, even managing to ruin 
 macaroni and cheese. On the other hand, Kendra's mother is an excellent 
 chess player, and has slowly been teaching her daughter the finer points of 
 the game.

 [SYLE]
 Kendra gets really nervous about her opponent's queen and tries to do 
 everything she can to get rid of it. Sometimes she pays so much attention to 
 doing this that she gets herself in a bad position. She is rated 790.

 found an antique chess set and fell in love with it; before long, he started 
 designing new chess sets and eventually found the time to learn the game. 
 Much to his surprise, he won a few times...

 [SYLE]

(  TEEA  )
 '------'
 [RATING]

 [BIOGRAPHY]
 A reluctant player, Teea only plays to please her grandfather in the few

 game at all, but she doesn't like to lose - and if you don't play, you can't 
 lose, right?

 [SYLE]
 Teea's rating is only 723, perhaps because she only plays chess once or twice 
 an year. To make things simpler, she always tries to clear the board of 
 pieces. Luring her into bad trades might be a good tactic.

Q: WHY AM I ASKED SEVERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT MY AGE AND PLAYING ABILITY WHEN I 
   START UP THE GAME FOR THE FIRST TIME?
A: CM10 asks you a few questions the first time you boot up the game in order 
   to assign you an initial rating. This rating obviously means nothing until   
   you start playing some games and prove yourself. For this reason, for the 
   first 20 rated games, your rating will be provisional.



Q: WHY IS MY RATING "PROVISIONAL"? WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
A: During your first 20 rated games, your chess rating is still provisional. 
   During these games, your rating will evolve very quickly toward a more 
   accurate representation of your playing strength. Afterwards, your rating 
   will evolve much more slowly.



Q: WHY CAN'T I PLAY GRANDMASTERS AND OTHER HIGHER-RANKED PLAYERS IN A RANKED 
   GAME?
A: When your rating is provisional, you can only play opponents 400 or less 
   points above your rating in ranked play. Although after the provisional 
   period has ended, there are no restrictions.



Q: WHICH TIME CONTROLS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE GAME? HOW DO THEY WORK?
A: To set up the time controls for the game, select the Time Controls tab when 
   creating a game. There are six time controls available.

   - Moves/Minute: Specify the number of moves each player needs to make in a 
                   certin number of minutes. Most chess tournaments are played 
                   at this rate.

   - Seconds per Move: Specify the number of seconds each player has to make a 
                       move. This time control is useful for setting the
                       amount of time it takes for the computer to move. Keep 
                       in mind that this is the average time it will take for 
                       the computer to move, and it may move more slowly or 
                       quickly on an individual move.

   - Minutes per Game: Specify the number of minutes each player has to 
                       complete the entire game.

   - Fischer Style: Assign each player a specified number of minutes to 
                    complete the game, with a certain number of bonus seconds 
                    added to the game each time a player makes a move.

   - Infinite Time: No time limitations for your game. Using this time control 
                    will make your AI opponent wait a lot before moving, so 
                    make sure to use the Force Move command extensively. To 
                    force your opponent to move, use the Actions/Force Move 
                    menu from either the right-click or drop-down menu. This 
                    option is available only in the Training and Set Up 
                    Position game modes.

   - Hourglass: Each player gets a specified number of seconds per move at the 
                start of the game. As one player uses time, the other player 
                gains the same amount of time (like an hourglass). So, if you 
                move rapidly, you can force your opponent to do the same.




Q: ARE ANY OF THE PREDEFINED TOURNAMENTS RATED?
A: Unfortuneatly, no.



Q: HOW DO I DISPLAY/CLOSE WINDOWS?
A: Most of the windows in the game can be closed by pressing the 'X' icon in 
   the upper right corner. To display the window again, use either the right-
   click  menu (look for the Windows section; visible windows are checked) or 
   the drop-down menu. If a window lack the 'X' icon, it means it can't be 
   closed and must remain on screen.



Q: CAN I CHANGE THE DISPLAY OF THE CAPTURED PIECES WINDOW?
A: Yes you can. There are three possible displays of the Captured Pieces 
   window. Fixed Position, displaying symbols for every piece type and the 
   number of captured pieces of that type; Order of Capture, displaying all 
   the captured pieces in the order in which they were captured; and finally 
   Piece Value, displaying all the captured pieces in order of piece value 
   (queens first, rooks second, etc). To change the display format, click on 
   the small icon next to the Minimize icon, or use the Preferencs/Captured 
   Pieces window.



Q: ARE THERE ANY HOTKEYS FOR THIS GAME?
A: There sure are.

I'd like to thank Ubisoft for making another great addition to the already 
impressive series. I'd also like to thank my family (particularly my father) 
for introducing me to the world of chess. But most of all, I'd like to thank 
the people at GameFAQs for guiding me through my first FAQ. I couldn't have 
completed this project without their support.
